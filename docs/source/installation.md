# Installation
----------------
If you are interested in simply using the package then you can install it as a standard package. For dev look below.


Current version is **2.0**

```
python -m venv venv

// Activate the virtual env
// On Windows run  venv/Scripts/activate
// On Linux bash source venv/Scripts/activate.sh

pip install golftracker
```

I have uploaded some of the test vidoes on [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ElxhtWFyLM9psTiCbrei8Ubj0A-c5-gh?usp=sharing) for testing.
