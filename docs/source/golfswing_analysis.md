# Introduction
List of items that can be *potentially* checked by the software.

## Swing Plane

Analyze whether the club is moving in the swing plane. It is common wisdom that being in the correct swing plane will lead to a solid contact and so increased consistency, accuracy and distance. Check the [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-fdkmLEdLiA) for details.

## Head Movement

Check if there is excessive head movement during the swing.

## Initial Position

* Check that the elbows point towards your hip.
* Feet shoulder width apart.
* Back is straight and knees only slightly bent.
* Body is tilted at the hips and not at the waist.

## Arm Movement

Ensure correct arm position during the various phases of a swing.

### Takeaway
Arms are relatively straight.

### Backswing

At the top of the swing the leading arm should be as straight as possible. The trailing arm bends at the elbow creating a "L" shape.

### Downswing

Dropping the club in the "slot" with the leading arm relatively straight and the trailing arm begins to straigten.

### Impact

At point of impact the leading and trailing arms should be straight.

### Follow-Through

After impact both the arms should be extended fully.
